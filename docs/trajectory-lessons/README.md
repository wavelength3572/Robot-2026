# Trajectory Optimization Lessons

Learn how our robot's scoring system works! Choose your track:

## Freshman Track (~2 hours)
**[FRESHMAN_TRACK.md](FRESHMAN_TRACK.md)**

A hands-on introduction focused on:
- Seeing the simulation in action
- Understanding the key components (turret, launcher, hood)
- Tuning parameters and competing for best scores
- Light code exploration with Claude

**Best for:** New programmers, visual learners, or anyone wanting a fun intro

---

## Senior Track (~3-4 hours)
**[SENIOR_TRACK.md](SENIOR_TRACK.md)**

A deep dive into the engineering:
- Deriving the trajectory optimization math
- Understanding feedforward motor control and SysId
- Exploring the physics simulation
- Challenge problems for further exploration

**Best for:** Experienced programmers ready for physics and calculus

---

## Quick Start

1. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew simulateJava
   ```

2. **Open AdvantageScope** and connect to see the robot

3. **Pick your track** and start learning!
